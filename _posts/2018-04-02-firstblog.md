### Welcome to My Blog
Hi! I'm Nikhila. This blog is an outlet for my ideas and musings on everything I find interesting.


### First post, new pages and intersting work soon
Setting up a blog on your own with minimal coding skill(or lack thereof) proved to be a herculean task. I'm still learning to work this stuff out, but I plan to update the page with some interesting themes, pictures and blog articles that I have been working on.

### References (referred repositories, themes used)

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It was designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
